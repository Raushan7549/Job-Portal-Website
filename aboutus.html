    <p>Info Edge has an in-depth understanding of the Indian consumer internet domain. With years of experience in the domain, strong cash flow generation and a diversified business portfolio, it one of the very few profitable pure play internet companies in the country.</p>
    <p>The company was incorporated on May 1, 1995 under the Companies Act, 1956 as Info Edge (India) Private Limited and became a public limited company on April 27, 2006. Starting with a classified recruitment online business, naukri.com, Info Edge has grown and diversified rapidly, setting benchmarks as a pioneer for others to follow. Driven by innovation, creativity, an experienced and talented leadership team and a strong culture of entrepreneurship, today, it is India’s premier online classifieds company in recruitment, matrimony, real estate, education and related services.</p>
    <h1>Businesses</h1>
    <p>Over the recent years, Info Edge has been able to garner greater shares of the classified market because of a general shift to more online activity and greater acceptability of its offerings in the online space. There has been a rapid acceleration in internet usage during this time in India; in fact, it took almost a decade to reach the first 100 million customers, while the second 100 million user base has been added in only three years. Internet penetration is witnessing exponential growth with mobile internet being the primary growth driver.</p>
    <p>While this represents a tremendous increase in the opportunities available for Info Edge, the company faces the challenge of creating products that are device agnostic. Consumer preferences are also evolving at a rapid pace and attention and efforts have therefore been focused on understanding customer behavior across mediums to deliver satisfaction through different products.</p>
    <p>To remain ahead of competition in an ever-changing volatile market, the company’s recent focus has been to develop new and updated apps for mobile phones for its classified online businesses to help customers stay on track with their search and discovery processes. The backend APIs and services infrastructure have been re-architected and main components simplified to support speed to market in launching new features for diverse devices and platforms.</p>
